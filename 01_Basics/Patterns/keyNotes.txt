All pattern questions have a general solution Approach.

Approach : 

1. Understand the Pattern:
   - Observe rows, columns, symbols (stars, numbers, characters).
   - Note symmetry, repetition, spacing, and direction (increasing/decreasing).

2. Break the Pattern Down:
   - Is it symmetric?
   - Is there a mirror or reverse part?
   - Does it use stars, numbers, or alphabets?

3. Dry Run with Small n:
   - Use n = 3 or 4 to manually analyze row/column behavior.

4. Identify Loops:
   - Outer loop → Rows
   - Inner loop(s) → Columns (spaces, stars, numbers, etc.)

General Rules : 

There are 4 general rules for solving a pattern-based question : 

1. We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop,
   we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.
2. Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow
   connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we 
   get the required number of columns to be printed.
3. We print the numbers inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of 
   two or more similar patterns.

*Note : 
1. For n rows pattern we need to find column dependency.
2. For 2n row pattern we need to analyze pattern, example: if mirror then we reverse.
3. for 2n column pattern we find the count of stars and spaces required beforehand.
4. For n column pattern we need to find row dependency.
